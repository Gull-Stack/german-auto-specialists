          <h2>Vincent Gillespie</h2>
          <p>Vincent — known to his customers as Vinny or Vince — didn't just learn to fix German cars. He grew up fascinated by the precision engineering that makes Audi, BMW, Volkswagen, and Mini stand apart from every other car on the road.</p>
          <p>That fascination turned into a career spanning over two decades. After years of honing his skills, Vincent opened German Auto Specialists in West Jordan, Utah, with a simple mission: provide dealership-quality German auto repair with the honesty, personal attention, and fair pricing that only an independent shop can offer.</p>
          <p>Today, customers drive from across the Salt Lake Valley — South Jordan, Riverton, Herriman, Murray, Sandy, and beyond — because they know Vincent won't sell them something they don't need, won't cut corners on quality, and will treat their car like it's his own.</p>
          <p><strong>"I'd rather lose a sale than lose your trust. If your car doesn't need a repair, I'll tell you. That's how I've built this business — one honest conversation at a time."</strong></p>
